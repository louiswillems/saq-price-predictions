# Predicting red wine prices from SAQ.com (Société des alcools du Québec)

<br>

**Objective**: The goal of this machine learning project is to develop a model that can predict red wine prices using SAQ data. We will also interpret the results to find the most predictive variables.

## Probleme definition

In this post, we will build a regression model in order to predict red wine prices. We will get the data from SAQ website (Société des alcools du Québec). To do so, we will first extract the data from <a href="https://www.saq.com/content/SAQ/fr.html"> SAQ.com</a>. Once we get the data that we need, we will build our regressor model to predict red wine prices.

In this machine learning pipeline, we will :
- Extract & uploading data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Naive Baseline
- Feature Engineering & Model Selection
- Model Evaluation on test data
- Model Analysis (Interpretability)
- Conclusion

*Important: For the purpose of our project, we will follow these steps in a linear fashion but machine learning pipeline is an iterative procedure.*
